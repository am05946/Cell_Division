# Cell_Division
In this game you defend against viruses as a white blood cell. In order to protect them you consume virus' and bacteria that threaten you by attempting to eat you. As you continue the game it gets progressively more difficult with there being 3 variants of virus. The three variants are Bouncers, chasers and wanderers and after you reach a certain mass you will fight their spawners who operate similarly to bouncers. If your white blood cell is eaten by larger virus' you will lose the game. If you grow large neough and eat all of the virus spawners you win the game.
